Stats fetcher and bot powering Twitter account @loonathetrends.

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.7
- PostgreSQL >= 10
- check `requirements.txt` for more (it's made with `pip freeze` so all secondary dependencies are baked in, sorry)

## Quick overview of how this works
1. `fetcher.py` takes care of getting the stats and storing them on the Postgres database
2. `tweeter.py` takes care of tweeting stuff
3. `loonathetrends` contains the fetching logic
4. `loonathetrends.bot` contains most Twitter related things
5. `loonathetrends.bot.plots` has the plot drawing logic
6. `loonathetrends.bot.templates` has the tweet templates
